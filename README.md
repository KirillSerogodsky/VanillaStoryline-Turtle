# VanillaStoryline
An enhanced version of the original vanilla wow gossip/quest dialog replacer.

# Installation:
Click the Code button to the upper right hand corner and select download or click [here](https://github.com/tubtubs/VanillaStoryline/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
Unzip the download into your Interface/Addons folder in your WoW directory. Eg: *C:\Games\Turtle WoW\Interface\Addons*
Rename the folder from *VanillaStoryline-master* to *VanillaStoryline*
Restart WoW and enable the addon and you should be good to go.
If there are any further issues with installation, ensure that *VanillaStoryline.toc* is in the root folder. There should be no subdirectories. Eg: *C:\Games\Turtle WoW\Interface\Addons\VanillaStoryline\VanillaStoryline.lua *

# Improvements:
- Disabled click through to avoid issues with spamming interact through the window
- Re-aligned the quest description text to avoid overlapping with the continue prompt
- Added an option to disable pfUIs gossip/quest skin, offering a solution to the blank window that spawns otherwise when using pfUI. This option is hidden if pfUI is not installed. The original option to hide the quest log exists seperately for compability.
