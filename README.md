# VanillaStoryline
An enhanced version of the original vanilla wow gossip/quest dialog replacer.

# Improvements:
- Disabled click through to avoid issues with spamming interact through the window
- Re-aligned the quest description text to avoid overlapping with the continue prompt
- Added an option to disable pfUIs gossip/quest skin, offering a solution to the blank window that spawns otherwise when using pfUI. This option is hidden if pfUI is not installed. The original option to hide the quest log exists seperately for compability.
